# Data Science Lab

Documenting how to perform Machine Learning and Deep Learning from scratch only using Pandas and Numpy 

## Overview
- **Kaggle Competions**: Playground of my kaggle competition Models and EDA notebooks  
- **Machine Learning**: Includes algorithms such as multiple linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, KNN, and more, all built from the ground up using basic Python libraries.
- **Deep Learning**: Will explores fundamental neural networks, backpropagation, activation functions, optimization algorithms, and more, using only Numpy for matrix operations and Pandas for data handling.

## Features

- Step-by-step code for implementing various ML and DL algorithms.
- Explanation of the math and theory behind each algorithm.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering using Pandas.
- Model evaluation techniques and performance metrics.
- No external ML/DL libraries required (other than Pandas and Numpy).
