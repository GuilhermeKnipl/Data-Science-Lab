# Data Science & Analysis Lab

A hands-on guide to building **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** algorithms from scratch using only **Pandas** and **NumPy**, with a strong emphasis on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

Most datasets featured in this repository originate from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), offering practical, real-world data challenges.

Explore the **Kaggle** folder for **exploratory analysis and modeling** on public competition datasets.

## üîç Overview

- **Kaggle Competitions**  
  A playground showcasing EDA and modeling notebooks for various Kaggle competitions.

- **Econometrics**  
  Includes fundamental econometric calculations:
  - **Moving Averages**:
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
  - **Time Series Models**:
    - AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA

- **Machine Learning**  
  Core ML algorithms implemented from scratch, including:
  - Multiple Linear Regression  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Trees  
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Model Feature Analysis

- **SQL Database Format for Data Querying**  
  Aims to store datasets in a lightweight Data Lake to allow filtering and querying with less verbosity compared to only using Pandas.  
  **WIP**: Building an ETL process to insert datasets into a `.db` file.
