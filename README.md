# Data Science & Analysis Lab

A hands-on guide to building **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** algorithms from scratch using only **Pandas** and **Numpy**, with a strong emphasis on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

Most datasets featured in this repository originate from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), providing practical, real-world data challenges.

Check the folder **Kaggle** for **exploratory analysis and modeling** in public competitions datasets
